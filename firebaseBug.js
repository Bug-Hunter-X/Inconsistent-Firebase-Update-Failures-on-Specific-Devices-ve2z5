In a Firebase project, when attempting to update a document using the `update()` method, an unexpected behavior arises. The update operation seemingly executes successfully without errors, but the changes are not reflected in the database.  The code uses a unique document ID obtained beforehand, making it improbable that the update is targeting an incorrect document. The data to be updated is straightforward (simple string values). The problem only occurs on specific client devices and is inconsistent; sometimes, updates work correctly.
