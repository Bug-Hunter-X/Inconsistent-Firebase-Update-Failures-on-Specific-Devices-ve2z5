The issue was intermittent and difficult to reproduce consistently. After numerous tests, the solution involved adding explicit error handling to the Firebase `update()` call and ensuring that the client-side data synchronization was robust enough to retry failed operations.  A comprehensive check was also done to make sure the user was authenticated and had sufficient permissions. The improved code includes these changes and ensures proper error handling and logging.  We also added exponential backoff retries to further enhance reliability.
